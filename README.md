### BSA

A demo of signing into the PSN network using official way through WebView on Android.

It can show your purchased games, recently played games and stats (only for recently played - shows play count, first/last launch datetime, total playtime). Pure placeholder app without other functions.

Was made in 2021 and fixed for new PS App auth method in 2023. Source code was not touched further - so not Jetpack Compose and other fancy stuff.

This might not get any updates, but feel free to modify something and use in your own projects (but please mention me if you can).
